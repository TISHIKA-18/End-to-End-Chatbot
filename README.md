# Chatbot with Machine Learning and Streamlit

This project is a **chatbot application** that uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Logistic Regression** for intent recognition. It features a user-friendly **Streamlit interface** for seamless interaction. The chatbot is capable of answering basic queries, providing help, and holding simple conversations.

## Features
- **Streamlit-Powered Interface**: A clean, simple interface for user interaction.
- **Intent Recognition**: Uses ML techniques to classify user input into predefined intents.
- **Customizable Intents**: Easily add or modify intents and responses in the `intents.json` file.
- **Scalable Design**: Code structured for future enhancements like multilingual support.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web-based interface.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model (TF-IDF and Logistic Regression).
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing and tokenization.
